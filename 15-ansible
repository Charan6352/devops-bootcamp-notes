Ansible
-> tool to automate IT tasks

Advantages:
 1. exec tasks from own machine
 2. config steps in single YAML file
 3. re-use same file multiple times
 4. more reliable

Ansible is agentless -> only need to install on one machine

Works w modules that get pushed to remote server, do their specific task, then removed
Can use vars w Ansible

Ansible Playbooks:
  task = execution of module w arguments + description
  tasks are executed in a sequence
  Play = sequence of tasks with host (where task should be executed) and remote_user (which user should exec tasks) defined
  Playbook = 1 or more Plays in single YAML file (can name Plays)
  
Values of hosts come from Ansible Inventory List, these hosts can be grouped
Vars can also be defined at group level to avoid repeating info for multiple hosts in that group

ad-hoc cmd:
  ansible all -i hosts -m ping
  ansible <HOST_GROUP || HOST> -i hosts -m <MODULE>
