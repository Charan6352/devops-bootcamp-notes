# Prometheus

Monitoring tool for dynamic container environments 
 
Components:
   1. Prometheus server
    - Data Retrieval Worker to pull metrics data
    - Storage via time series db
    - HTTP Server to accept PromQL queries from Prometheus Web UI or Grafana
    
Metrics defined by help (description) & type (counter, gauge, histogram) entries gathered from targets (own application for eg)

Targets need to expose /metrics endpoints with correct format to Prometheus
For target that don't have exporter by default, can use Exporter. Prometheus has list of Exporters for different targets

Prometheus is pull system - advantages:
  - multiple Prometheus instances can pull letrics data
  - no risk of monitoring becoming bottleneck like push systems
  - better detection/insight
However, disadvantage is difficulty to scale so important to limit number of metrics (can also use Prometheus Federation that allows a Prometheus server to scrape other Prometheus servers)

Can define rules for aggregating metric values or creating alerts when condition met, defined within prometheus.yaml file

Prometheus has component Alertmanager which fires alert when condition is met
    
Monitoring of K8s Cluster Node Resources out of the box    

Optimal way to deploy prometheus in K8s -> use Helm chart to deploy operator 

Can adjust Prometheus config -> which endpoints to scrape
Can also adjust alert rules 
Config Alertmanager to send notification in case of alert triggered from set rules

Visibility of monitoring data -> Prometheus UI
 In Prometheus, instance = endpoint that can be scraped
 job = collection of instances w same purpose
 
For data visualisation -> Grafana UI
 data structure - folders > dashboards > rows > panels

Alert rules run on expressions in PromQL, each expression is based on metrics and filters within Prometheus functions 

Prometheus operator allows use of CRD (custom resource definitions) inside K8s - can use kind: PrometheusRule for deploying new rules, AlertmanagerConfig for alert manager rules
