# Prometheus

Monitoring tool for dynamic container environments 
 
Components:
   1. Prometheus server
    - Data Retrieval Worker to pull metrics data
    - Storage via time series db
    - HTTP Server to accept PromQL queries from Prometheus Web UI or Grafana
    
Metrics defined by help (description) & type (counter, gauge, histogram) entries gathered from targets (own application for eg)

Targets need to expose /metrics endpoints with correct format to Prometheus
For target that don't have exporter by default, can use Exporter. Prometheus has list of Exporters for different targets

Prometheus is pull system - advantages:
  - multiple Prometheus instances can pull letrics data
  - no risk of monitoring becoming bottleneck like push systems
  - better detection/insight
However, disadvantage is difficulty to scale so important to limit number of metrics (can also use Prometheus Federation that allows a Prometheus server to scrape other Prometheus servers)

Can define rules for aggregating metric values or creating alerts when condition met, defined within prometheus.yaml file

Prometheus has component Alertmanager which fires alert when condition is met
