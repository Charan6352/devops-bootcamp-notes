DB Types:

- Key Value
Redis
very fast but limited storage
used for caching, message queue

- Wide Column (multiple columns per key)
Cassandra, Apache
scalable but no joins
used for time-series, IoT records, historical events

- Document (containers for key value pairs)
MonogDB, DynamoDB
slower writes but faster to read
used for mobile apps, game apps

- Relational
MySQL, Postgres
store structured data
schema and data types needed to start
data organised into tables with rows & columns
normalised to avoid duplication
ACID: atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability
difficult to scale

- Graph
Neo4j
reduce complexity of connections
best for graphs, patterns, recommendations

- Search
ElasticSearch, Solar
creates index of words that is searched only

can combine multiple DB types together depending on App needs
