AWS SERVICES

Examples of services provided by AWS
  EC2 - virtual servers
  S3 - storage
  VPC - network
  IAM - users & permissions
  ECR - container storage
  ECS - container orchestration 
  EKS - container orchestration w Kubernetes

Services scopes:
  1. global - eg. IAM
  2. region - eg. S3, VPC
  3. AZ (Availability Zone) - eg. EC2

IAM - Identity Access Management
  create users and assigning permission to them
  best practice to create admin user with less privileges than root user (root created by default when creating AWS account)
  this admin user can then create other human users & system users
  groups can be created
  unlike IAM users, policies can't be set directly for AWS services - need to create IAM role first and then attach the policy to the IAM role (policy specific to service)

Regions and AZ
  Region = physical regions where data centers are clustered
  Availability Zone = 1 or more discrete data centers - used for replication/backups

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
  created by default for each region
  own isolatted network in cloud
  spans all AZ (Subnet) in that Region
  Subnet for each AZ - private network inside network
  Firewall Rule config make Subnet either private or public
  internal IP range for VPC - for comm inside VPC, not for external traffic
  Subnet then gets sub IP range based on VPC's internal IP range
  also get public IP address 
  Internet Gateway connects VPC to outside internet
  NACL (Network Access Control List) config access on subnet level 
  Security Group config access on instance level

CIDR Blocks
  range of IP addresses
  lower number /xx - the higher the range
  VPC has CIDR block - Subnet sub CIDR block
  
EC2 - virtual server in AWS cloud
