### Automation w Python

Boto3 - python library for aws

client vs resource
  client = more low-level API
  resource = wrapper over client, higher level and object-oriented
  
terraform vs python
  - tf manages state of infra, idempotency is respected however py doesn't have state
  - tf is higher level
  - with python boto you can do more things because of its low-level API, more complex logic possible (monitoring, backUps, scheduled tasks etc.)
