Terraform -> automate & manage infrastructure
declarative -> define end state

connects to platform provider using:
  - core (tf-config + state inputs) -> compares actual vs desired state
  - providers each giving access to ressources

useful cmd:
  refresh
  plan
  apply
  destroy

Providers
  not included in Terraform download -> providers need to be installed 'terraform init'
  good practice to define separate file providers.tf that contains all required providers config (specific versions etc)
  provider gives access to api of certain technology (aws for ex) -> can interact with all provider resources
