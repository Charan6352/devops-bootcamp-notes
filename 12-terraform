Terraform -> automate & manage infrastructure
declarative -> define end state

advantages:
- version control (history)
- simple replication of infratructure possible
- simple clean-up
- easier team collaboration

connects to platform provider using:
  - core (tf-config + state inputs) -> compares actual vs desired state
  - providers each giving access to ressources

useful cmd:
  refresh
  plan
  apply
  destroy

Providers
  not included in Terraform download -> providers need to be installed 'terraform init'
  good practice to define separate file providers.tf that contains all required providers config (specific versions etc)
  provider gives access to api of certain technology (aws for ex) -> can interact with all provider resources
  
  resource -> create new resources
  data -> query existing resources
  
  always apply terraform config file
  
variables
  create vars in terraform.tfvars file
  terraform apply -var-file <file>
  use variables to replicate same infrastructure for different environments
  can provide default values
  can type vars
  
  can declare global env vars -> export TF_VAR_<var_name>="<value>"
  then ref var in config file
  
provisioners
  alternative to using user_data - which isn't in terraform's control as terraform initializes infra and then passes on user_data to be executed to provider after infra is initialized
  provisioner executes cmd in terraform
  provisioner "remote-exec" - exec script on remote resource after it is created
  need connection attribute to connect provisioner to remote server
  provisioner "file" - copy files or dir from local to newly created resource
  provisioner "local-exec" - invokes local exec after resource is created
  
  provisioners NOT recommended by terraform - can lead to unexpected behavior, breaks idempotency concept -> best to use config mgmnt tools instead of "remote exec" (ex Ansible)
  best to use local provider instead of "local-exec" provisioner
  
 modules
  group resources that can be reused based on a logical unit
  works with inputs (variables) and outputs (values)
  dependent on providers 
  
  file structure with "root" module and child modules with each their own config
  whenever module changed/added, need to run terraform init
  
 Remote State
  terraform writes data to remote data store
  benefits:
    - share state among team
    - backup for data
    - keep sensitive data off disk
  configured in terraform metadata in tf config using 'backend' attribute
  need to run terraform init to connect to backend
  
  Best practices
    - only change state using TF cmd
    - set up remote storage backend for state file for team sharing
    - use state locking to avoid concurrent edit conflicts
    - backup state file - enable versioning 
    - use 1 state per environment 
    - host TF scripts in own git repo
    - CI for TF code
    - apply infra changes only through CD pipeline
