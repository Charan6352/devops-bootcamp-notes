CLOUD & IaaS

app, jenkins need to run on server 

delegate infrastructure mgmnt -> move physical server to cloud

IaaS providers: 
- aws
- google cloud
- microsoft azure
- digital ocean

by default all external connections to server are closed
need to config firewall rules
SSH port = 20
inbound rules to range IP addresses

useful cmd:
ssh login -> ssh root@<ip-address>
copy paste file -> scp <file_locally> <destination> (example destination: root@<ip-address>:/root
run jar file -> java -jar <jar_file> 
run jar file detached mode -> java -jar <jar_file> &
check app running -> ps aux | grep java
check on which port app is running, lists servers that have active connections -> netstat -lpnt 

best practice is to create user for every app and give it only permission it needs to run the app
add user to sudo group -> usermod -aG sudo <user_name>
switch user -> su - <user_name>
logout -> exit
terminate process -> kill -9 <PID>

to ssh to user, need to add file .ssh/authorized_keys in home dir of user want to connect to, containing public key of user want to log in from
