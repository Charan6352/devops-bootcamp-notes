K8s on AWS - EKS

ECS vs EKS

  ECS - Elastic Container Service - manage lifecycle of containers
    create ECS cluster containing all services to manage containers (control plane)
    containers themselves run on EC2 instances (Docker and ECS agents to communicate w control plane)
    still need to manage the instances (more effort but better control of infrastructure)
    EC2 vs Fargate
      Fargate is alternative to EC2 instances - serverless way to launch containers (no need to provision & manage servers)
  EKS - managing K8s cluster on AWS
    option if already use K8s
    K8s is open-source, less lock-in effect with ECS that is specific to AWS so more difficult to migrate
    better option in general for managing containers 
  
Steps to create EKS cluster
1. provision EKS cluster
2. create NodeGroup of EC2 instances
3. connect NodeGroup to EKS cluster

ECR - Elastic Container Registry 
  repo for Docker images
  integrates well with other AWS services
  
Fargate profile runly one pod per virtual machine (so no adapted to stateful apps)
Uses namespaces and labels to select which pods run with Fargate (when using combination of both node groups and fargate)

can use eksctl to create clusters instead of aws console
