BUILD TOOLS & PACKAGE MANAGER TOOLS

package app into single movable file to deploy to environment -> artifact
involves compiling, compressing
keep artifact in storage with backups

file different for each language
java -> JAR or WAR file

build artifact with build tool (installs dependencies and compresses)
java -> maven or gradle

run app
java -jar <artifact_name>

javascript has no special artifact type
javascript -> npm or yarn (packager managers NOT build tools)
package.json to manage dependencies
npm install -> install dependencies
npm repo for searching dependencies and install locally
zip/tar file includes app code but NOT dependencies, so need artifact + package.json to run app
npm start -> start app locally

can package front end and back end separately or together
front end needs to be transpiled, compressed/minified -> webpack
npm run build

push artifact into artifactory, which can then be pulled

with Docker, makes process easier
- just 1 artifact type -> Docker image
- just 1 repo for Docker images
- no need to install dependencies on server as can exec install cmd inside Docker img
still need to build file first before copying into Docker img

build tools for DevOps
- help devs for building the app
- config CI/CD pipeline
